The piece I'm going to talk about is a projection activated poster that I made for the class Experimental type. The poster is printed using a 4 color CMYK laser print. On top of which handwritting and illustrations are rendered using a fluroscent highlighter.

For the creation of this poster, I used 20lb 24x36 inches paper printed on using a wide format laser at the OCAD U printshop. Along with the mechanical production of using a laser printer, I also drew on the poster using a fluroscent highlighter. The poster is activated through a projection mapping process. I made a video on after effects that Mapps onto the poster. The video projection oscillates between different colors that reveal coloured elements on the poster. The changing colors from the video turn the poster into a live object that changes with the interactions between the light and the colored elements on the poster.

The poster uses three main colors. A tone of blue, a tone of magenta and fluroscent yellow that comes from the highlighter. They all sit in solid colored layers on the poster. The colors were rendered in RGB color values and designed with these when viewing them on the screen. Upon printing the color environment changed from RGB, which is based on\ the color that is made from led pixels on the screen made up of red, green and blue to CMYK which is made up of 4 inks, them being Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Key (black).

The colors used in the projections are red, yellow, green and blue. They exist in a RGB color environment. However instead of light coming from individual LED pixels to combine into an image, a laser projector creates images by directing laser beams which are RGB(red, green, blue) onto a screen using mirrors. A digital signal modulates beam intensity and position rapidly, forming pixels and motion.

The reasoning to use these colors is because they are complementary colors. The colors were chosen based on an investigation of how projector lights interact with the printed lights. The projectors light when it shines on the poster to reveal the color on the opposite end. For instance blue light when projected on the poster will hide the blue color printed on the poster, and the yellow will be highlighted and become visible.

To this add how does this use of color impact overall atmosphere and effectiveneness

Split this above writing into an 
(1) description 
(2) scientific analysis

Description will take the following structure: 
The first portion of this report should describe the piece of visual art and the process of its
creation, such as the materials and techniques used. You should also describe the different
colours in this work and how they were added or incorporated into the product. Finally, you can
provide your own reasoning as to why those particular colours were selected and how the use
of colour impacts the overall atmosphere and effectiveness of the piece.


For the scientific analysis do this:
(1) The scientific analysis portion of this report should describe the physics of how colour is
generated for the audience, including the specific materials and/or techniques used in creating
the different colours in the piece.


(2) Research and support by reputable sources 
included in this section to explain the origin of those colours.
> A minimum of 5 sources is required, with inline citations where appropriate, including at least 1 peer-reviewed journal article.

(3) For example, you could describe the pigments used in colouring a piece of cloth,
(4) Explain how that colour is created by that pigment’s chemical properties, and the spectrum of light that is
reflected or emitted.

*"The laser printer uses a large memory to print the whole page at once. The digital page view creat-ed in the memory of the printer is transferred to the drum with the help of a laser gun. Toner sticks to the parts of the drum magnetized by the laser beam. In this way, the desired characters and graph-ics are formed on the paper touching the drum."*

** Workshop I: Proposal
*** Key points
Explore procedural book making
emergent, play, collage within mechanical systems (venn diagram)
-> Quote huzinga
focus on commincation and presentation

*** General notes
- Play, experiment and explore, but lean on the side of communicating what you're doing and it's presentation
- Keep making stuff, but also present them. As zines, newsprints, posters, etc. All outcomes to be frozen(print/image/mp4), if there is interactive components, make sure to document it with steps for reproduction.
- Keep (I) for breadth and exploration, make divergent jumps and try different small experiments
- Keep (II) for depth & presentation, explore projects in (I) more thoroughly, present well, and stitch together to make a coherent point (or not).

*** Sparse notes
- Execute computations physically
- Printing methods based on print masters and stuff, but perhaps with paper. Eg. ink transfer kind of stuff. Waxy prints, negative for water based smth to pass thru and print? a sieve sort of? Poneder...
- Algorithms, physarium, WFC, its explainations as zines. Zines may incorporate these algorithms in its structure
  
*** Exercises
- Explore Physarium Algorithm
- Use it to create layouts
- Explore creating matrix with book spreads, x, y, z (3 dimensional matrix... space... math stuff?) 
- Desiginig italo calvino's books and incorporating structure of narrative or space in his books into the structure/form of the book
- Wave function collapse with book spreads + spread layouts even... like taxonomic informations systems or puzzle books or smth. (RM book ali class)
- Publishing a paper on procedural bookmaking?

** Business Description
*** odd-monitor/off-unit.studio
We are a web design and development studio focused on bridging the gap between digital and physical media. While print design tools are highly refined, web design remains dominated by developer-centric tools and workflows. Our goal is to bring design-driven thinking into the digital space, creating unique web experiences that reflect the richness of physical media.

Positioned at the intersection of digital materiality, physical computing, and AI, our studio aims to push the boundaries of how the web can feel, function, and inspire.

Hi Jer!
 
I’m doing good, hope you are well too :)
 
Very exciting to hear from you, this sounds like an awesome project, and I’d love to chat and help/collaborate in any way possible. I would want to know more about the creative lab you are working on so I can give more specific ideas.
 
But till then, some thoughts of the top of my head…
 
First of all I’m curious how the hosting for option 1 would work. I don’t have much experience with WebRTC or Touchdesigner but I'm guessing if you're planning to use Touchdesigner you would need some kind of server setup? Is this something that is within the bounds of this website?
 
I'm not sure if you've seen this, but mediapipe also has a js implementation that works in the browser, which is awesome! Although ml5.js is pretty good itself too.

I've played around with the ml5 hand/posenet before but just to toy around and experiment, nothing concrete though. I've been reluctant in the past to explore webcam based interaction (as a primary method of interaction) for any public facing websites for a few reasons. I think people generally are not very keen on giving webcam access for browsing websites. When people do, gesture based navigation tends to be flaky at times, for instance it won't work in low-light situations or if you have an oldish webcam, etc. And sometimes you just don't have access to a webcam, if say you're browsing on your monitor or something of sorts.
 
But regardless of all of this, I think it makes for a very exciting interaction when it works. I haven't seen (m)any interesting implementations previously done so I'd be very keen on seeing how something like this plays out and would love to explore alongside as well. Examples I’ve previously seen are the touchdesigner stuff on Instagram and all, which has been within the bounds of the software rather than on a website.
 
Something that does come to mind though is this website I saw some time back, but seems like it doesn't work anymore. From when I saw it, a painful montage would play as long as you kept smiling.

Beyond the gesture based interactions, riffing of the word 'alive' in context of websites... I think of it in two ways... one obviously being the opposite of static, being dynamic which there's plenty of examples to look at. Some that come to mind:

I also really like thinking of alive in the sense of websites responding to their environment, Yehwan Song's work comes to mind:
 
https://yhsong.com/
 
She has a lot of installation work but the browser based work might be the thing to look at for this context.
 
I'm not sure if you have a technical audience, if so, I've been wanting to make a website for a while that would be navigable from the browser devtools console, as in instructions and relevant information would be console logged and functions would be exposed globally that could be executed by typing them in the console. That would reveal pages on the browser page.
 
This website/tool I recently came across (which is super cool itself) implements the executable functions from the console thing.

Lastly (and then I'll stop I promise), thinking of alive and rituals,,, did you ever play farmville on facebook :))
I remember as a kid when I discovered farmville, I thought it was 'real' in some sense since it kept state over the days unlike the ephemeral online games. Harvesting crops and stuff took 'real time', like hours or so... in some sense it was sort of a ritualistic mechanism (or maybe an addiction mechanism depending on how you seen it) that would bring you back to the game over time. I'm wondering if a time based mechanism, maybe not harvesting crops but something that tethers the website to our lived world could be interesting.
 
This website by Linked by Air comes to mind. But I'm sure there's more examples.

Studio Moniker has tons of projects in similar themes as well.

If the lab has a physical space and server setup, something like this would be super fun too:

Sorry for the extensive blabber,
Hope to hear more from you soon!
 
Cheers,

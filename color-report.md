# Outline

### Intro

###### [1] Describe the piece
The piece I'm going to talk about is a projection activated poster that I made for the class Experimental type. The poster is printed using a 4 color CMYK laser print. On top of which handwritting and illustrations are rendered using a fluroscent highlighter.

For the creation of this poster, I used 20lb 24x36 inches paper printed on using a wide format laser at the OCAD U printshop. Along with the mechanical production of using a laser printer, I also drew on the poster using a fluroscent highlighter. The poster is activated through a projection mapping process. I made a video on after effects that Mapps onto the poster. The video projection oscillates between different colors that reveal coloured elements on the poster. The changing colors from the video turn the poster into a live object that changes with the interactions between the light and the colored elements on the poster.

The poster uses three main colors. A tone of blue, a tone of magenta and fluroscent yellow that comes from the highlighter. They all sit in solid colored layers on the poster. The colors were rendered in RGB color values and designed with these when viewing them on the screen. Upon printing the color environment changed from RGB, which is based on\ the color that is made from led pixels on the screen made up of red, green and blue to CMYK which is made up of 4 inks, them being Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Key (black).

The colors used in the projections are red, yellow, green and blue. They exist in a RGB color environment. However instead of light coming from individual LED pixels to combine into an image, a laser projector creates images by directing laser beams which are RGB(red, green, blue) onto a screen using mirrors. A digital signal modulates beam intensity and position rapidly, forming pixels and motion.

(3) reasoning as to why those particular colours were selected
	- how the use of colour impacts the overall atmosphere and effectiveness
	  The colors were chosen based on an investigation of different light and color interactions.


### Scientific Analysis

(1) The scientific analysis portion of this report should describe the physics of how colour is
generated for the audience, including the specific materials and/or techniques used in creating
the different colours in the piece.

The color is printed using a laser printer on matte paper. The color is generated for the audience based on the pigments used.

(2) Research and support by reputable sources 
included in this section to explain the origin of those colours.
> A minimum of 5 sources is required, with inline citations where appropriate, including at least 1 peer-reviewed journal article.

(3) For example, you could describe the pigments used in colouring a piece of cloth,
(4) Explain how that colour is created by that pigment’s chemical properties, and the spectrum of light that is
reflected or emitted. 

### Reflection
(1) The final part of the report is a reflection section where you will need to answer the following questions.
  (a). How effective was the use of colour in this work?
  (b). What changes would you make to the colours used? Explain your answer.
   (c). Has the additional scientific understanding of colour improved your appreciation of this
	piece or other similar works? If so, in what way?
  (d). Discuss at least two possible ways that a better understanding of light and colour may
  be useful in your future career path

### Format:
Include a title page listing:
- your name
- an interesting title for your report.

**Make sure to also include An introduction and conclusion in addition to the three required sections.**

The written portion of the report needs to be single-spaced and have a length of between 3 to 5 pages
(~1500 - 2500 words).

You will need to reference the external sources that you use with both in-line citations and a list of
references. Note that you will need to use the APA format for this course.

Please consult the Perdue Online Writing Lab (link on Canvas) or the OCAD Writing & Learning Centre for more information.

Figures, pictures, or diagrams sufficient for the reader to understand your chosen work needs to be included as an appendix at the end of the document. Remember that the chosen work needs to be created in whole or in part by you.

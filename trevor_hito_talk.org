* Psyops, Hallucination
 The more prominent or lets say more important question is how have AI/technologies made us hallucinate, how have they prompted us to hallucinate and how do our hallucinations take on a life of their, turning hallicinated things real.

Cultural objects to be crushed and converged into a single plane: the iPad. Yet the single plane has axis, any space is dvisible, and division of such space is a way to discipline it. Dividing time into chunks makes it legible, and such is the same with space. Creating such a division, amplifies the polarization that this division creates.

Everything looking the same. The aesthetic convergence, is a symptom of the political convergence.

I started this year reading _The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time_ which was the most heart warming (and wrenching) book ever. All the chapter numbers are prime numbers.

I watched _Can I get a Witness_ in February.

June was the most ethereal month ever. I watched _Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives_ which comes back to me in waves, for reasons I can't put a finger on yet. I saw _Drive My Car_ and rewatched _Memoria_ and I heard the birds sing.

I Travelled back to India and watched _A night of Knowing Nothing_ on my own (which broke my heart) and _Perfect Days_ with my parents (which was an insane experience).

While there, I stumbled upon the reading _[Listening to the Language of Birds](https://emergencemagazine.org/practice/listening-to-the-language-of-birds/)_ and I went on walks with my 6 year old cousin veer who enjoyed listening to the birdsongs as much as me.

I came back to Toronto and watched _Juniper Tree_ with Omama at TIFF

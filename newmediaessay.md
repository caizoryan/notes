### Introduction

Programming is generally seen as practice that takes place solely in a technical domain. Common practices and perspectives suggest that programming is accesible solely through a symbolic and logical mode of engagement. In this essay I will argue that programming can be accessible through a mode of engagement that isn't purely logical or symbolic and that programming is greatly impacted by cultural and social dymanics. I will use a subgroup of programming known as visual programming to make my point. 

Visual programming supplements the act of programming by incorporating visual syntax and semantics which not only make the practice of programming and computation more accessible but also broaden the scope of what constitues as programming. I will argue that visual programming languages  (VPL)  are an attempt at reframing programming/computing as a cultural practice rather than solely a technical practice.

I will be explaining what constitutes as programming by outlining it's properties. Futhermore I will analyse specific visual programming projects and how they are able to reframe what programming is by making the mechanics of computation accessible through other modes of engagement rather than being solely a symbolic and logical mode of engagment.

### Programming languages and interfaces
To understand visual programming languages, first we have to break down the basic concepts of what programs and programming languages are. 

> A program is an executable definition of a calculation that accepts variable inputs. It is created by a programmer, using some kind of programming system, though not necessarily a general-purpose language.

So essentially a program is an instruction sheet of things to be executed on the hardware, an instruction sheet which is able to take inputs at the time of execution to alter its behaviour...

> A programming language is a symbolic notation with (a) a defined syntax; (b) language constructs and (c) semantics that associate meaning in the application space with programs.

...and a programming language is a way to write out these  instructions for the computer to execute. Programming languages eventually get compiled down to machine code which has a material presence as electricity and transistor states. Rather everything on a digital computer is electricity encoded in transitor states that can be interpretted and represented in ways on a computer screen. 

This is an important point because it implies that programs and programming languages both have the same material presence -- electricity. What we see them as, either as text or images (GUI) are representations of the program or programming language.

Lev manovich in his essay database as a symbolic form writes, 

>Some media objects explicitly follow database logic in their structure while others do not; but behind the surface practically all of them are databases. In general, creating a work in new media can be understood as the construction of an interface to a database. In the simplest case, the interface simply provides the access to the underlying database.

In this way we can consider that programming languages or code (media objects) can be accessed and manipulated through an interface. An interface like text editors allows a user to access code by representing it as text, and it also gives the user the tools to manipulate the represented text through basic text editing skills. This is the conventional way to write and edit code. Through a textual interface.

### Visual programming languages
So text is one representation of a programming language, or rather an interface to edit code. However programming languages or code can be represented in any various forms. This is the space visual programming languages exist. They present themselves as alternative forms of representing and manipulating with programming languages.

//  insert image of a vpl with same code

Scratch is the canonical example of visual programming languages. In the above example we can see a window of a scratch program.
Encoding program structure through visual cues. For instance in the above image we can see [[[ THAT : x is contained withing y, etcc... so these cues help in comprehension of the structure and introduces spatial properties in a symbolic context. ]]]

Generally this process is done through a code editor, where you can manipulate a string of text that is human readable (using words understandable and parseable by us). Visual programming languages take a step further where instead of using solely text, they give the user the ability to use graphic interfaces in order to edit text.

### Programming paradigms are cultural
It is not that nature of programming itself is logical and sequential.

The cultural and social dynamics of programming self selects. So if a person is good at logical and sequential thinking, theyll stumble upon programming and think, ok this is easy and become a programmer. But that would propogate the idea that programming is logical and sequential. 

However if we have alternative modes of engagement with programming and computing. Then more people who think in ways that aren't solely logical and sequential are able to engage.

We're going to talk about how the sprit of excitement and curiosity promotes and ecology of sharing.

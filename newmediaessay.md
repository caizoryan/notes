In this essay I will be writing about visual programming languages  (VPL) and how VPL's have generally stemmed from a spirit of sharing and making computing more accesbile for people. I will be explaining what constitutes as visual programming by outlining it's properties. Futhermore I will analyse specific visual programming projects  and how their provenance can be traced to a sprit of sharing and making computing accesible.

Programming is generally seen as practice that takes place in solely a technical domain. Common practices and perspectives suggest that programming is accesible solely through a symbolic and logical mode of engagement.

In this essay I will argue that programming can be accessible through a mode of engagement that isn't purely logical or symbolic and that programming is greatly impacted by cultural and social dymanics. I will use a subgroup of programming known as visual programming to make my point. Visual programming supplements the act of programming by incorporating visual syntax and semantics which not only make the practice of programming and computation more accessible but also broaden the scope of what constitues as programming. 

In this essay I will be writing about visual programming languages  (VPL) and how VPL's are an attempt at reframing programming/computing as a cultural practice rather than solely a technical practice. I will be explaining what constitutes as programming by outlining it's properties. Futhermore I will analyse specific visual programming projects  and how they are able to reframe what programming is by making the mechanics of computation accessible by other modes of engagement rather than solely a symbolic and logical mode of engagment.


















So we're going to talk about software (and/or) code as media. As a thing that communicates and produces cultural effects. We're going to talk about how the sprit of excitement and curiosity promotes and ecology of sharing.  

Visual programming is one such tangent of a larger effort in movement to make programming more accessible for people.

I am going to write an essay about new media. yes this I will. This is correct.

What is this going to be about?

Woop woop, its going to be abotu visual programming. What is that you ask? Let me explain you. 

Visual programming is when you aid the process of programming with visuals. Ok that's pretty reasonable, but I can infer that from the term itself. So how do you define this term better.

FOr that we probably wanna exaplain what programming is. 

Ok so programming is writing symbolic instructions for the computer to execute. Programming languages are languages you can write this symbolic instructions in which get combiled down to machine code which has a material presence as electricity and transistor states. Generally this process is done through a code editor, where you can manipulate a string of text that is human readable (using words understandable and parseable by us). Visual programming languages take a step further where instead of using solely text, they give the user the ability to use graphic interfaces in order to edit text. For instance if in your code you want to enter a color, the editor can show a color picker where a value can be selected and it will output the string of value to the final program.

So just got high again and realised ok, I'm still interested in the UI stuff. I like working with and making live environments for making stuff. 

So finish this semester and work well on presenting and consolidating research and ideas. 



Some links to consider:

Also just make an arena-notetaker already. All the ingredients for it are already there. One mind model that will be interesting to use there will be implementing a virtual filesystem. So block can be stored as a file object. So it would initially have last modified as the block modified date and any time there is a change made in this editor it would be marked as edited. Then to sync I can just see which all blocks were edited and sync only those.

Some more line of thoughts --->
I can write a simple mount script that will mount an are.na channel as markdown files in a directory and change all the links from are.na http links to local md links. And when pushing back to are.na have them turn back to are.na links. This way it can be used with obsidian or emacs.

And can easily add and delete blocks. I can look into positioning and play around with it to...

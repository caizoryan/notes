Hey! I'm very passionate about the topic. I'm currently in my final year at ocad. Over the past few years I have been exploring computational design practices and have gotten more and more interested in exploring alternative ways to of engaging with computation that differ from the currently dominant practice. 

I'm also a fan of cory doctorow's work and have been following his work on similar topics over the past few years and was super excited when I heard of this workshop :)

I've worked with mostly software, (c, c++, javascript, lua, lisp, java, some python) and dabbled around with hardware... arduino's and rasberri pis. I would love to meet like minded people in our locality and generally hear from people how they're all navigating our current predicament with tech and work with them to build things.  


I feel that we're (society at large) slowly forgetting that our computational devices are general purpose computers, i.e they are able to perform any form of computation. Restrictions are placed on them through SOFTWARE that can be overridden through software! I think if you own devices you should be able tinker with them and alter with them. I get EXTREMELY INFURIATED when apple tells me to update my MacOS just to view an embeded JPEG on my notes app. 

I feel strongly about people being able to have access to their own devices. And I have fun making alternative tools that I can tinker with and mess around with. 


I've been making tools for graphic design practices. Here is a publication design tool I've been working on for the past few weeks. It gives you the affordance to design unconventional book formats.

I feel strongly about people having control over their own computational devices, being able to tinker with it and use it to make stuff however they want. I think the idea/narrative that computers are general purpose machines that can be molded to whatever form we desire is missing from how we perceive these devices and I think fictioning out these alternates is a way to work towards the goal.

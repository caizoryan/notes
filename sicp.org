* Introduction to Computation
Just basic imperative, declarative stuff...

** Procedure and data abstraction
Creating abstractions/black-boxes. Interfaces and programming paradigms -> in order to make abstractions work together. Interfaces are essentially what programming is all about, bringing abstractions together.

** Metalinguistic Abstraction
Layered languages, hardware/register languages... This seems interesting. Curious to see what this will be. 

** Computation as a metaphor
Capture descriptions of computaitonal practices to design solution to complex problems.
Using language to do so - need fundamental primitives (means of combination and abstractions)

** Distinction between process and procedure
Process as exact steps, and procedure describes the steps

** Scheme
*** Language primitives
    numbers
    strings
    booleans

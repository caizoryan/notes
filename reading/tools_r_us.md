# Tools R US
*Joost Grootens* 

The history of graphic design has been envisioned as that of the designer. In this article, I will use the pronoun “she” to refer to graphic designers, in order to highlight the diversity of practitioners in the field and to call attention to gender disparities in the descriptions and historiography of graphic design, which produces visual information by taking control of specialized tools and procedures.
[3. Richard Hollis, “Have you ever really looked at this poster?” (1994), in Sara De Bondt and Catherine de Smet (eds.), Graphic Design. History in the Writing (1983–2011), London, Occasional Papers, 2012, p. 73.]

The arrival of the personal computer and software had nearly completed this process. However, during the digital era, tensions have emerged in the relationship between the designer and her tools. Whatever the case, she is no longer strictly monogamous. The existence of a reciprocal relationship between specialized graphic tools offering a specialized role and a specialist practice that justifies the creation of highly specific tools is not a given.

Over the decades surrounding the transition to the 21st century, tools for creating, recording, editing, producing, and disseminating visual information became accessible to everyone, while graphic designers simultaneously adopted the tools and roles of other fields. Design thus lost its monopoly as a specialist in the production of graphic information and, at the same time, became so multifaceted that it started to resemble a “vast shapeless body.”
[4. Andrew Blauvelt, “Towards Critical Autonomy, or Can Graphic Design Save Itself?” (2003), in Michael Bierut, William Drenttel, and Steven Heller (eds.), Looking Closer 5: Critical Writings on Graphic Design, New York, Allworth Press, 2006, p. 9, our translation.]

So what, then, should the designer do in this whole mess?

It seems naïve to long for the period between the introduction of the Mac and the widespread adoption of Web 2.0 technologies — that brief era in which the designer, for the first time, had access to the full suite of technologies for creating, recording, editing, producing, and distributing visual information, while still maintaining a relatively uncontested monopoly over their use.

With the increasing accessibility of production tools, the role assigned to the designer extended beyond her traditional responsibilities. But she had not yet evolved alongside non-specialists who could do the same, thereby challenging her position.

At the risk of stretching the metaphor a bit too far...


Shouldn’t monogamy itself be questioned — whether this relationship still makes sense, whether it should be abandoned, or whether an entirely different role should be chosen?

In this text, I will wander through both the practice and theory of the relationship between the designer and her tools. I will focus on young designers who are still students, while also considering non-specialists who have appropriated the graphic tools of creation, recording, editing, production, and publishing of visual information.

All these practices share a common thread: they extend, question, or destabilize what we consider to be design tools. I will reflect on what the constantly evolving relationship between the designer and her tools implies for her role, the discipline, pedagogy, and the historiography of design — at a time when we are moving toward the era of the post-graphic designer.

### The Design Tools of French Female Students

A few years ago, I began investigating the state of graphic design. In the theory and writing on the discipline, I could only find limited descriptions or unsatisfying interpretations of what I had experienced in my own practice as a graphic designer — particularly the ongoing transformation of the relationship between the designer and her tools, and the resulting shift in the designer’s position.

The gap between what I encountered in theory and what I had experienced through practice led me to carry out an investigation. This took the form of a series of workshops, a doctoral research project, and modest experiments and inquiries within my own practice.

For example, I studied the CVs of designers applying for internships in my studio. I was interested in the skills and tools that young designers list when applying to a design studio. It was also about understanding how the new generation of graphic designers perceives the discipline and what expertise they consider important in order to gain a place within it. And finally, how educational institutions envision...

How is graphic design conceived, and what skills are considered necessary for young designers to become competent?

There is much to say about this investigation. It only concerns applications sent to a single design studio, which operates in a very specific niche of the discipline: book design and information design. For some academic programs, internships are mandatory, which can influence the motivation to apply — just as the student’s financial resources or the appeal of the city of Amsterdam, where my studio is located, can affect the makeup of the group of applicants.

But in my view, this study aims to identify trends and broader movements, rather than to make general claims about designers, the discipline, or design education. At the same time, I dare say that it does more than simply map out specific cases, since it covers a period of several years and takes into account a significant number of cover letters.

Such research, if conducted on a larger scale and over a longer period of time, could make a valuable contribution to the mapping and interpretation of a discipline in motion. What was carried out in my studio is only a first exploration.

For this article, I revisited the investigation into the skills and tools mentioned in the cover letters, but this time I focused on internship applications coming from France, between January 2016 and July 2022. This concerns just over one hundred applications (out of approximately one thousand international applications received during that period).

Incidentally, the comparison of these applications does not reveal any major difference in terms of software skills between the French students and those from other countries, or even...

...other regions of the world. There is a clear trend showing that students are proficient in the same standard industrial tools, sometimes supplemented by other digital skills. Figure 〚1〛 presents the anonymized results, organized by school. The candidates who listed their skills in their CVs came from thirty-two French schools. If several students came from the same institution, all the stated skills are presented under that school.

You might wonder what the point is of listing all these means of creating, recording, editing, producing, and distributing graphic information. In this list, I identify several distinct sets of tools based on different technologies, which involve different graphic production practices. But also different roles of designer and user — and varying definitions of graphic design and of who we consider to be designers.

In this sense, the skills that a designer includes in her CV reveal how she understands the discipline and the role she sees herself playing.

The idea that the nature of design tools affects the essence of graphic design is not universally accepted. For some, digital technologies are simply a new set of tools. In the epilogue of Meggs’ History of Graphic Design (2012), authors Philip B. Meggs and Alston W. Purvis describe digital technologies as an additional toolkit.
[5. Philip B. Meggs and Alston W. Purvis, Meggs’ History of Graphic Design, 5th ed., Hoboken, John Wiley & Sons, 2012, p. 572.]

They write eloquently in the final two paragraphs:

“As often in the past, the tools of design change with evolving technology. The essence of graphic design, however, remains unchanged. This essence is to organize information, to give form to ideas, and to impart expression and feeling to the artifacts that document human experience. The new generation of graphic designers must take charge of defining new aesthetics in electronic media and not allow technology to dictate them. In doing so, the new generation will pave the way for new and more effective approaches to their discipline.”

The quote from Meggs’ echoes the sentence that opens this article: the graphic designer takes control of the tools and thereby determines those of the discipline. However, I seriously wonder whether that is still truly the case. But before we ask that question, let’s take a closer look at the differences between various sets of graphic tools. What differences can we observe, and how do they establish different types of practice?

### THE CHRONOLOGY OF TECHNOLOGICAL THRESHOLDS

During my doctoral research, I developed a model to describe the transformation of graphic design, based on how different sets of tools define specific graphic practices.
[7. Joost Grootens, Blind Maps and Blue Dots. The Blurring of the Producer-User Divide in the Production of Visual Information, Zurich, Lars Müller Publishers, 2021, p. 41.]

Titled “Chronology of Technological Thresholds,” this model is based on the various roles adopted by the designer throughout the changes in design tools, as analyzed by graphic designer and curator Andrew Blauvelt.
[8. Andrew Blauvelt, “Tool (or the Graphic Designer Faces Post-Production)” (2011), trans. Véronique Rancuret, rev. Samuel Vermeil, Azimuts, no. 47, “Work,” 2017, pp. 88–103, https://revue-azimuts.fr/numeros/47/outil-ou-le-designer-graphique-face-a-la-post-production

Digitization is the merging of different tools—and thus tasks that were previously separate—into a single super-tool: the computer and design software. This expanded the designer’s scope of action, increasing her role, but she was no longer the specialist with exclusive access to graphic tools.

In contrast, dissemination concerns the (speed and scale of) information distribution, interaction and exchange with others, as well as universal accessibility to graphic production means.

This model sets a series of successive conditions for different types of graphic information production and usage practices, each with its own levels of accessibility in terms of economics or required specialized knowledge. Today, designers’ practices are fluid; they move between multiple technological spaces, sometimes choosing to produce using pre-digital and even pre-industrial technologies, while opting for internet-based distribution formats for other stages of the same project.

The model also allows us to position different types of usage: from more passive uses to participatory forms enabled by Web 2.0 technologies, to usages in which the distinction between producers and users completely disappears.

The space between the various thresholds in this model—as well as their slope—show how quickly and on what scale graphic design is transforming. The curve for mechanization technologies follows a gentle slope, whereas the curves for digitization and dissemination are steeper. This means that technologies involving computers and the internet were introduced over a shorter time and on a larger scale.

The space separating the thresholds is even more revealing. The curves for mechanization and digitization are further apart than those between digitization and dissemination, indicating that these stages are following each other increasingly rapidly.

For this article, as shown in Figure 〚2〛, I have included the tools specified in the French internship applications in the chronology. The tools that French students mention in their CVs appear in bold.
These CVs highlight tools primarily situated within the digital realm—technologies that greatly multiply designers’ access to the production of graphic information. Only a few tools belong to the dissemination threshold, technologies that have increased the openness of the field to the point that it is no longer a specialist activity.

### THE DOMINATION OF TOOL PRODUCERS

The list of skills in the applications from French students situates their practices while revealing that they mainly rely on tools from a single company.

All the students have a strong command of Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator: respectively, the layout and design software for print and digital media, the pixel-editing software, and the vector-editing software from the American software company Adobe. A few other graphic editors appear in the candidates’ CVs, but these three Adobe tools are the only ones mentioned consistently. These applications are part of Adobe Creative Cloud, a suite of software tools intended for graphic design, video editing, online development, and photography, corresponding to industry standards in many creative fields.

The results of this inventory among French students are confirmed by a series of workshops called “Atlas of Design Tools,” conducted in Swiss and Dutch schools, which examined the political, social, environmental, and economic aspects of design tools.
The tools used daily by participants were studied in workshops held in the graphic design departments of the École cantonale d’art de Lausanne (2016), Zurich University of the Arts (2017), Design Academy Eindhoven (2018), and Bern University of the Arts (2018). All these workshops, except one, were supervised in collaboration with Dimitri Jeannottat. The results, translated into visual formats—maps, timelines, and diagrams—were presented in a book, Atlas of Design Tools. At the start of each workshop, participants listed the tools they used most. Out of more than one hundred participants, a large majority named an Adobe software as their preferred weapon. The top ten tools in each workshop invariably included, often in the top positions: InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop.

The inventory of French design students and the workshop results testify to Adobe’s dominance in creative software. Alternatives exist outside Adobe’s tools, both commercial and open-source, and it seems important to consider the whole ecosystem. Adobe’s suite allows easy transfer of elements designed in one application to another. For digital culture theorist Lev Manovich, this transition between tools and media is typical of the software era, where “import” and “export” functions and associated commands matter more than individual operations offered by the programs. In other words, when dealing with graphic design tools, we must consider the suite of tools as a whole. At this level, there is no alternative to Creative Cloud, no other software suite as comprehensive or offering such easy exchange as Adobe.

Why should the domination of a single software company be a problem for the graphic designer and the design field? If Adobe’s products are so widely adopted by designers and industry, it must mean the company is doing its job well. Beyond the usual drawbacks of a monopoly—where the monopolist has little incentive to improve products or maintain low prices—some disadvantages also impact design practice.

Design software has incorporated tasks, or, in software language, “features,” that in the pre-digital era were performed by independent specialists or contained within specific production means. Think of typesetting, lithography, color charts, composition aids, etc., which are now integrated into design software. The menus and default settings of design tools come from choices made by the software producers and inevitably reflect a particular conception of design. This management of design functions within a dominant tool reduces the range of options available to designers, and thus also the imaginable results. Controlling the tasks built into design software can improve the tool’s functionality and optimize the minimal quality of an outcome, but it is also at the cost of the diversity of visual expression.

The dominant position of a software suite in a field is not limited to Adobe Creative Cloud for graphic design production. Consider, for example, Microsoft’s role in academia: Word to compile texts and research projects, PowerPoint for conference or class presentations, and Excel for quantitative research, making diagrams, or tracking budgets. The domination of a tool in a given discipline risks leading to a specific but limited practice. Some authors even argue that certain tools impact the results. Statistician and information design critic Edward R. Tufte has argued that PowerPoint forces users to create presentations based on “an extremely hierarchical, one-way structure as a model for organizing all types of content,” which “transforms information into sales pitches and presenters into marketers.”

Another critique concerns Adobe’s economic model. Since 2014, Adobe software has only been available by subscription. For a monthly payment, the user gains access to one or more tools. The subscription cost is high and almost exclusively accessible to those whose specialized practice uses the software daily.

This tool. While the use of pirated versions of the software is widespread, it does not constitute a satisfactory solution. Since Adobe regularly updates its products and printers as well as many graphic production companies are up to date, the designer is subjected to the perpetual update cycle if she wants her work to be produced. This analysis regarding Adobe would equally apply to the impact of computer manufacturer Apple, smartphones, social networks, printers, print-on-demand services, and online distribution channels. The impact of these tools on graphic designers’ practices and on graphic design itself is considerable. These tools sometimes give the impression of controlling the practices and the discipline, rather than the other way around.

The opening sentence of this article refers to a statement by graphic designer Richard Hollis, who said that graphic design develops in tandem with the designer who takes control of her tools and procedures. This statement was made in 1994, in the interval between the digitization of tools and the previously described widespread access — that gap between the digitization and dissemination curves in the chronology of technological thresholds — and now seems naively optimistic in light of the obscene economic health of current tech monopolies, online surveillance scandals, and the “gig economy.”

¹Translator’s note: Literally "economy of small jobs." This term refers to the new forms of employment associated with so-called collaborative platforms like Uber and Deliveroo and their social and economic exploitation.

For the designer to reclaim control of her role in the field of graphic design, she will need to change her relationship to the tools. To do so, it may be useful to observe non-specialists who have appropriated graphic tools, as well as the strategies and practices they have developed. Understanding them could help the graphic designer to assert her position within the discipline.

### LEARNING FROM NON-SPECIALISTS
What relationship do graphic design tools have with the practices of non-specialists who have appropriated them? One might think that these novices, because they do not have to take responsibility for knowledge of the context or a position linked to a discipline or its heritage, can do whatever they want and however they wish. Will they be able to develop new models, new relationships to these tools that we, graphic designers, use in our practices? I will now "suspend judgment"² and focus on creators, writers, and editors of visual information who are non-specialists. I will concentrate on their ways of creating, recording, editing, producing, and distributing rather than on what they do.

On the timeline of technological thresholds, the practices I will analyze mostly relate to dissemination. They sometimes use tools from earlier periods.

The Dutch Thomas van Linge was a sixteen-year-old high school student when he published his first map of Syria on Twitter in 2013³.
³Thomas van Linge (@ThomasVLinge), "IMPORTANT: map about the current situation in #syria. green = regime, brown = #FSA, blue = contested," Twitter post, June 24, 2013, accessed July 24, 2022, https://twitter.com/ThomasVLinge/status/349243455425368064

GPS drawing is another type of practice that blurs the boundary between production and usage. Individuals run, pedal, swim, drive a car, a boat, or a plane along a predefined route and draw a line on a map using the global positioning system (GPS) on a mobile phone and software like a fitness app to record their activity. Like the practices of amateur conflict cartographers, the tool chosen to collect data is the same as the one used to publish the visualization. But unlike conflict maps, GPS drawing is also an invitation to recreate the drawing: the line is both an image and a route that others can reproduce.

The platform on which the GPS drawing is published determines to what extent it also functions as a route. The practice of American Claire Pisano focuses primarily on the image. On her Instagram account @dick_run_claire, she publishes urban landscapes where GPS drawings of penises appear, which she traces while running¹.
¹Claire Pisano (@dick_run_claire), Instagram story, accessed July 24, 2022, https://www.instagram.com/dick_run_claire/

Strava users. Using a Garmin GPS device and the Strava app, Koppert records his routes in GPS exchange format (GPX). The GPS file generates the image of the drawing, which he sends to his children via WhatsApp, but he also shares it as a dataset on Strava, where other athletes can download it onto their mobile devices and use it as a route to follow themselves⁵.
⁵ Koppert’s Tour of Italy drawing was, for example, ridden by former professional cyclist Erik Dekker and shared with his followers on his public Strava feed (Erik Dekker, “Giro d’Italia! Can be done in just one day!”, Strava post, May 6, 2020, accessed July 24, 2022, https://www.strava.com/activities/3406535371

Movements of the dancers, which stutter forward and backward. Other elements of the song, such as sound effects, rhythms, and lyrics, are also interpreted as dance movements or lip-synced playback⁶.

What interests me in this video is the translation of the song into dance, which also includes movements imitating the camera and editing techniques. For example, some dance moves create the illusion of tracking shots (a shot where the camera moves relative to the subject being filmed), movement control techniques like steadicam (where the camera movement is isolated from the cameraman’s movement, producing smooth shots), and digital post-production techniques like horizontal and vertical panning (the horizontal movement following the rotation of a shot). Integrating digital cinematic effects into analog dance is an example of a post-digital paradigm, in which the interaction between digital, biological, and cultural evokes the humanization of digital technologies. I am not an expert in dance, but I perceive parallels between Pierce’s work and other dance movements that seek to create illusions. One example is the Moonwalk, where the performer glides backward while the body action suggests forward movement. This move was popularized by American pop musician Michael Jackson in the 1980s but dates back to the 1930s.

A characteristic feature of Pierce’s videos is leaving the dancers’ movements out of the frame and showing only their visual effects. In the video, the dancers are visible only from the waist up; their legs and feet do not appear in the image. The videos are filmed with the selfie camera of a smartphone or a tablet fixed on a tripod in a domestic setting. The video adopts a portrait format, unlike the landscape images typically seen in movies and on television. The image is also a mirror; in many of Taylor Pierce’s videos, you can read the names and slogans on t-shirts and caps backwards. The contrast between the extremely sophisticated dance movements and the simplicity of the recording technique wonderfully enhances both elements. It makes the dance movements even more irresistible. The lack of pretension—such as the dancers’ casual style, the domestic setting, the lip-sync to pop music, the use of a selfie camera, and sharing on social media—makes the video highly relatable and heightens identification with the dancers.

As designers, the practices of René Koppert, Thomas van Linge, Claire Pisano, and Taylor Pierce teach us that opting for accessible production methods has economic and political advantages. The simple production modalities of these democratic technologies invite creators of form and content to develop new types of visual subtlety to reach and affect others. Moreover, gathering and sharing the process of research, design, and publication nourishes a flexible and open practice that proves transparent, recognizable, and conducive to dialogue. Blurring the distinction between production and use can be the foundation for new practices of co-creation, co-recording, co-editing, co-production, co-publication, and co-use of visual information.

### PEDAGOGY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY

In the last part of this text, I want to step away from practice and focus on pedagogy and the interpretation of graphic design. How can these insights about the impact of tools on practice and the lessons we learn from non-specialist practices influence pedagogy and historiography of design?

Regarding pedagogy, it is first necessary to understand that digital technologies are not simply new design tools. To grasp the complexities of these tools, we must both analyze them and learn to use them. So, not only mastering the tools but also critically reading them—examining who produces them, who owns the technology, where they are designed, by whom, under what conditions, and what their economic, political, and environmental consequences are.

By turning to reflection, educational institutions would become the ideal place to reconfigure the discipline and overcome its current existential crisis. It is by actively seeking and developing other graphic design tools and practices that schools can reclaim a central position in the debates animating the discipline. A position they lost when the monopoly on specialized design practice taught by schools disappeared in favor of powerful technological companies that manufacture graphic production means.

Research and revaluation of the discipline can take place precisely because schools represent an intermediate position between individual practices and industry. It is therefore imperative that schools be truly independent. Of course, they should not submit to powerful tech companies or give them too important a role in training. On the other hand, schools also have the task of looking beyond individual desires, momentary illusions, or governments’ will to train designers who can immediately enter the job market. Educational institutions have a responsibility toward the discipline of graphic design, especially toward its future.

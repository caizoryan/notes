Tools and languages are mental models that we use to express and explore virtualities. Possible potentialities for things to become. Through material, labor and craft we translate those potenials into becomings, into tanglible objects. 

I am making tools for bookmaking processes. Tools that help me typeset, compose, sequence, impose and produce a digital file that can then be printed out. These tools produce and environment where conventions can be reworkes and represented through diagrams and simulations that help me prototype alt-books.

I am using (programming and geometry) as [devices] to -> probe (graphic coventions and languages), in order to 
(1) Produce potentialities of graphic design workflows devoid of any Commercial (Adobe) software.
(2) Learn (graphic coventions and languages) by constructing them from ground up in software. 
(3) Learn (programming and geometry) and how to view it and employ it in a graphic contexts.

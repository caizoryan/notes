####  slide 1.
Like, hi, my name's Aaryan. I'm a graphic designer. 


####  slide 2. 
I also code. 

#### slide 3. 
Therefore, I'm interested in the following conditions. 

#### slide 4. 
I'm interested in terms like page size, spread, grid, signature, sheet and all of the bits and pieces. 
These are words of natural language that constitute this thing called book. 

#### slide 5.
So I thought to myself what would it take
to bootleg something like indesign

#### slide 6.
The first thing that comes to mind when you think of a software that can make books, is:
words.

So, typesetting!
[basic algorithm, x, y, word length, line length]

and then you can do stuff like->
[show type hooks]

#### slide 7.
Ok so whats next? I have words on a white box, but how can I turn this white box into paper?
I need scale... and the scale needs to translate to pixels when I'm working but correspond to
real units -> [em, inch, points]

#### slide 8.
[em, inch, points] -> become units now to find and pplace stuff on surface
grid to make legible space


#### slide .
imposition
[explain imposition]
[single signature, two signatures]


#### slide .
till now I was bootlegging indesign which I had valid reasons for...
I needed software alternatives to Adobe

but that didn't seem enough, because there already exist these alternatives. What was I 
gaining from building something like this from scratch?

I needed to utilize the affordances that came from building this tool from the ground up.

And I had just spent all this time play


#### slide. 
When I start to program and think of ways in which books can be 
re-disseminated or taken back apart or reconstituted,
you have to go from a natural language to something else

soft fudgy edge where like natural language becomes coded or syntax

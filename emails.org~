Hey Adam!

How's it going? 

I am travelling to Vancouver tomorrow, and will be back on the 9th, and then flying back to India on the 20th. The week after coming back is looking a little tight so I'm not sure I'll be able to join you to work on the keyboards this time, but if you're planning to work there during that time I'll try to drop by to see you one of the days!

In other news I'm going through the K&R C book and have been having alot of fun. At some point I side tracked and made this snake game:

And then got distracted further and tried to see how hard it would be to do some network requests in C, turns out not as hard as I thought (had some help from libcurl and cJSON). Ambitious goal is to re-write a node based offline proxy server I have for Are.na in C this summer. How hard can strings really be? I'll update you in two months :) 

Hopefully will be making my way through the SICP book over the summer and In preparation I've been tinkering with emacs (evil-mode) and playing around with the emacs lisp, which has been great fun! This live environment stuff is bonkers! What do you mean I can just execute code and make things happen in this editor! crazy... I think you can do similar stuff in neovim with lua as well but I never got into it, this feels quite intuitive.

Anyways, let me know if you're planning to be at x-fab in june, will try to drop by!

best,
Aaryan

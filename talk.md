### Call out conventional design practices

Establish and call out conventional design practices and ways to do things.

- Softwares working in specific contexts (vector, raster, motion).
- Importing and exporting between them.

Software seen as a thing given to the designer to work with.

### Creative coding

Also known as generative design, poetic computation, procedural design, conditional design.
These practices already exist and allow for novel forms to emerge.
	
### The slop problem

Now with AI, anyone can produce a coded sketch that can engage with this process of creative coding. However fine tuning with AI as of yet has been a big issue.

Removing friction from producing or making something, as seen over the last year naturally gives rise to slop.

The problem?

- lack of friction
- no engagement with process

The problem is that AI is largely being viewed as a solution rather than a convenience. 
So what do we do instead?

### Process as product, output as sideffect
Code affords us the ability to design processes, mechanics -- environments in which we can work as designers. The output in these systems become the side effects as we fine tune the process.

Identity systems are encoded in mechanics of the tool rather than a style guide.

### Small little tools coming together
The workshop of the designer not seen as a Adobe, but rather small contained task specific tools that can be moulded as needed.

Analogies to a physical. 
A pen can be used to write text, draw lines, used as a hair pin, a drumstick. Dissasemble it and you can make a crossbow. If you're not fussy about hygeine, use it to stir your coffee. Its pretty mouldable.

A pen tool in illustrator on the other hand, it can plot points... and thats it?

When software is given to you there's not much you can do with it. There's no moulding it. You can't make it work specifcally for the task at hand.

### Treating Code as a craft

Building your own tools gives you the affordance of having full control of what your tool can do. More over it gives you the affordances to take apart aspects of one task specific tool, and pick what you need for the next tool, and mould it for that specific task.

> connecting different regions and patiently rebuilding the workshop within the tools that effectively destroyed these regions.

Generally coding is seen as something that is supposed to make things happen faster. 

But creative processes need things to be slow. They need reflection and engagement. 

Coding as craft: in a time when designer are urged to constantly decorate their bio with strategic labels, a craft is a reflective activity, in the sense that the crafted things and the tools for crafting are a refelction of their maker, who generally recognizes themselves in them.
	
### Viewing code as a tool to engage rather than means to automate

New forms of storytelling through real-time and data-driven systems.

notes from Graphic Design in the post digital age: (Silvio Lorosso essay)

graphic design is turning into a job that can be turned into a button.

this is the pardox of creative coding: the coding part is supposed to make things faster, the creative part requires that things go slowly.

Coding as craft: in a time when designer are urged to constantly decorate their bio with strategic labels, a craft is a reflective activity, in the sense that the crafted things and the tools for crafting are a refelction of their maker, who generally recognizes themselves in them.

Roberto Arista: 
> Programming then can become a way to escape [the confinement of desktop publishing software], connecting different regions and patiently rebuilding the workshop within the tools that effectively destroyed these regions.
